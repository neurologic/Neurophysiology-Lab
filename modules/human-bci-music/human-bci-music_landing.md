# Week 12. Human Motor Neuron Coding

In vertebrates, every voltage spike in a motor neuron generates a voltage spike in the muscle fibers it innervates. A single motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates are called a *motor unit*. In humans, the only single-unit neural activity that we can measure non-invasively is from motor neurons (albeit indirectly via the muscle fiber spike). 

Today you will be recording the activity of individual neurons in the motor system of yourself and/or each other. Specifically, you will be using differential electrodes on the surface of the skin to pick up the extracellular voltage signal associated with muscle cell action potentials. Every time a pre-synaptic motor neuron fires an action potential, the muscle cells that it innervates fire an action potential. This one-to-one relationship enables the muscle action potential to serve as a proxy for the motor neuron action potential.
