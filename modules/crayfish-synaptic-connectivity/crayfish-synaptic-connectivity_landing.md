# Week 10-11. Synaptic Connectivity 

This lab requires simultaneous measurement of voltage activity in Motor Nerve 3 and a Superficial Flexor Muscle Cell of the crayfish.

## Arthropod neuromuscular junctions

Arthropod muscle innervation is different from vertebrate muscle innervation in several interesting ways:
- Arthropod muscles are innervated by relatively few excitatory motor neurons (sometimes only one).
- Arthropod motor neurons innervate each muscle fiber at multiple points (multiterminal innervation).
- More than one motor neuron may innervate one muscle fiber (polyneuronal innervation).
- Inhibitory motor neurons may innervate muscle fibers (and sometimes the terminals of the excitatory motor nerve endings).
- The tonic superficial flexor does not have “all-or-none” propagated action potentials, but instead has graded electrical responses dependent upon the level of the excitation and inhibition. The degree of depolarization determines the amount of Ca2+ that enters the cell through voltage-gated channels; the amount of Ca2+ entry in turn determines the strength of muscle contraction. Note: unlike the superficial flexor, fast phasic crayfish muscles may fire Ca2+-based action potentials.

Therefore, arthropod skeletal muscle integration (innervation and summation) is actually more analagous to cortical dendritic integration in vertebrates. As in human brains, glutamate is an excitatory transmitter and GABA is an inhibitory transmitter. The multiterminal, polyneuronal, and inhibitory innervation of crustacean muscle, the use of glutamate and GABA as transmitters, and the extensive synaptic plasticity make the crayfish neuromuscular junction a good simplified model for the complex mix of synaptic interactions that occur in our own brains.

## The Crayfish Superficial Flexor System

In crayfish, the ventral branch of the third nerve (N3v) in each abdominal ganglia innervates the superficial flexor muscle in the corresponding segment of the tail. The SF is a thin muscle sheet on the ventral surface of each tail segment, immediately under the cuticle (skin). N3v is purely motor, with no sensory axons. Thus, all of the action potentials recorded from this nerve are commands that set the contractile state of the muscle and consequently contributing to tail posture. The superficial muscle functions mostly in maintaining the posture of the animal. Motor neurons of the N3v are tonically active while the animal is at rest or performing terrestrial walking (Moore and Larimer, 1988). In contrast, motor neurons that innervate deep muscles instead generate brief bursts of action potentials associated with powerful tail-flip movements. 

## Experimental Goals

In this lab, your ultimate goals are to:
- Record extracellularly the spontaneous and evoked activity in the nerve 3. Based on the amplitudes and patterns of action potentials, you will hypothesize how many axons are present in the nerve.
- Record intracellularly from the superficial flexor muscle and examine spontaneous post-synaptic potentials.
- Simultaneously record extracellularly from nerve 3 and intracellularly from the superficial flexor muscle, observing spontaneous postsynaptic potentials in the muscle and matching them to action potentials in the nerve. These recordings will illustrate basic principles of synaptic integration and can allow you to map the innervation of the muscle.
	> If the simultaneous recordings are going well, you can stimulate nerve 3 and record the elicited postsynaptic potentials in the superficial flexor muscle. This method can be used to demonstrate synaptic plasticity at the neuromuscular junction, including facilitation, synaptic depression, and long-term potentiation.
