# Week 3. Giant Fiber - CAP

## Giant Fiber systems

## Annelids
Common earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) have a *giant fiber system* consisting of a single median giant fiber and two lateral giant fibers. Each giant axon is formed from many individual neurons whose axons fuse into a single functional unit, but whose cell bodies remain separate. The two lateral fibers have numerous reciprocal electrical synapses and therefore normally fire together. 

In mediating the *startle response*, the median giant receives sensory input from the anterior end of the worm, and the laterals from the posterior, so that normally the median and laterals conduct in opposite directions.

Components of the flight reflex, mediated by the MGF pathway. Mechanical stimulation of the worm front end leads to activity in skin sensory cells. This activates sensory interneurons that are connected to the median giant fiber. The MGF is connected to segmental giant motorneurons that elicit contraction of longitudinal muscles in the body wall. A positive feedback loop, via a single interneuron, can enhance the flight reflex by eliciting a second, or even several more, action potentials of the MGF.[^kladt-2010]
