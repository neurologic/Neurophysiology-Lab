# Week 3. Giant Fiber - CAP

## The great escape
Escape behaviors are stereotyped motor behaviors in response to threatening stimuli. They often need to be as rapid as possible. Many animals have escape behaviors that are mediated by **giant fiber** systems.  

## Annelids' Giant Fiber system
Common earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) have a *giant fiber system* consisting of a single median giant fiber and two lateral giant fibers. Each giant axon is formed from many individual neurons whose axons fuse into a single functional unit, but whose cell bodies remain separate. The two lateral fibers have numerous reciprocal electrical synapses and therefore normally fire together.

The median giant receives sensory input from the anterior end of the worm, and the laterals from the posterior, so that normally the median and laterals conduct in opposite directions.

Components of the flight reflex, mediated by the MGF pathway. Mechanical stimulation of the worm front end leads to activity in skin sensory cells. This activates sensory interneurons that are connected to the median giant fiber. The MGF is connected to segmental giant motorneurons that elicit contraction of longitudinal muscles in the body wall. A positive feedback loop, via a single interneuron, can enhance the flight reflex by eliciting a second, or even several more, action potentials of the MGF.[^kladt-2010]

## Complex Action Potentials

There are many aspects of the giant fiber system that can be studied using non-invasive extracellular recording techniques using the intact animal. With these techniques, the activity measured is referred to as a ***complex action potential*** (CAP). This compound action potential (CAP) is the algebraic summation of all the action potentials produced by all the fibres that were fired by that stimulus.  

In this lab you will study the response of the giant fibers to electrical (and potentially mechanical) stimulation using a ***differential*** amplifier. With this measurement technique, two pairs of metal electrodes that are both in contact with the nerve (from the skin surface of the earthworm), therefore the potential difference is compared between two points on the nerve.  
Remember, from your work investigating the *electric circuit model of the passive membrane,* that both the classic intracellular action potential and the compound action potential are biphasic. In other words, they have both positive and negative deflections, but for different reasons. The negative phase of the intracellular action potential is attributed to the ionic conductance mechanism of after-hyperpolarization. The negative phase of the CAP is due to the manner in which it is recorded. In this lab you will be able to manipulate the configuration of the differential electrodes and test its effect on the shape of the measured cap (and what you can infer about the nervous system anatomy based on the effects). Specifically, you can expect that the shape of the CAP will depend on the:
1. relationship between the inter-electrode distance
2. length of the axon segments depolarized by the action potentials
3. conduction velocities of the active axons  
Why do you think you would expect each of those dependencies? What are your predictions about how each will change the cap? Review your results and analysis from all week 1 passive membrane models to prepare.
