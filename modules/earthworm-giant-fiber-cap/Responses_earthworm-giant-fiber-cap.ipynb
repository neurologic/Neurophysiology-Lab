    "***Prompt 1: One of the most used equations in neurophysiology is $V=I*R$, where $V$ is voltage, $R$ is resistance, and $I$ is current. Another well-loved neurophysiology equation is $\\tau=R*C$, where $R$ is resistance, $C$ is capacitance, and $\\tau$ is the time constant of the membrane. Refer to the raw data you collected for Part IV (with R = 5 MOhm and the 103 Capacitor) to complete the following (show your work):  \n",
    "A) Use the amplitude of the experimentally-applied stimulus current and the corresponding measured change in voltage to calculate the model membrane's Resistance (compare your result to the value of the effective total resistor that you used). NOTE: make sure to account for the amplifier's amplification gain.  \n",
    "B) Use the time constant that you measured in Prompt 5 and the resistance that you calculated in A (above) to calculate the capacitance of the model membrane.*** "
