    "***Prompt 1: One of the most used equations in neurophysiology is $V=I*R$, where $V$ is voltage, $R$ is resistance, and $I$ is current. Another well-loved neurophysiology equation is $\\tau=R*C$, where $R$ is resistance, $C$ is capacitance, and $\\tau$ is the time constant of the membrane. Refer to the raw data you collected for \"Passive Membrane Properties\" Part IV (with R = 5 MOhm and the 103 Capacitor) to complete the following (show your work):  \n",
    "A) Use the amplitude of the experimentally-applied stimulus current and the corresponding measured change in voltage across the model membrane to calculate the model membrane's Resistance (using V = I * R). Compare your result to the value of the effective total resistor that you used. NOTE: make sure to account for: 1) the amplifier's \"gain\" on its output and 2) the amplifier's conversion between voltage reported and current delivered across the electrodes.  \n",
    "B) Measure the time constant of the model membrane from the raw data. Include a figure of the raw data (one pulse/response pair) showing where you are making each measurement. Show your work for any necessary calculations. \n",
    "C) Use the time constant that you measured in (B) and the resistance that you calculated in (A) to calculate the capacitance of the model membrane (using Tau = R * C).*** "
