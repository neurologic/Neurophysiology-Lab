# Week 1. Introduction to Passive Physiology Principles



Broadly, you will use electrical circuit models of a passive cell membrane to introduce yourself to some of the basic components of your essential electrophysiology toolkit. You will perform "intracellular" and "extracellular" measurements of membrane potential and, in an intracellular configuration, measure the membrane potential response to an "applied" current. 

Today's *Lab Manual* is an [Executable Notebook](../../howto/Executable-Notebooks) that you will also use to analyze some of today's data. Follow the instructions after opening it in Colab (using the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/modules/passive-membrane-models/Lab-Manual_passive-membrane-models.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Open In Colab" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"/></a> button here or at the top of the [Lab Manual](../passive-membrane-models/Lab-Manual_passive-membrane-models.ipynb) page). You will also need to use the [Dash Data Explorer App](../../howto/Dash-Data-Explorer) for visualizing data from the last experiment.

After you are finished with the data collection for today, respond to the questions in the *Responses* page after opening it in Colab (using either the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/modules/passive-membrane-models/Responses_passive-membrane-models.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Open In Colab" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"/></a> button here or at the top of the [Responses](../passive-membrane-models/Responses_passive-membrane-models.ipynb) page). Remember to "***Save a Copy to Drive*** in the file menu so that you can come back to your work or that it does not accidentally get lost. Upload any images or figures (in '.jpg' or '.png' format) that you create as part of your responses to your Google Drive so that you can insert them into the Responses notebook. After you have completed your work, 'Save as PDF' and upload to Gradescope.
