# Week 1. Introduction to Passive Physiology Principles

Today's 'Lab Manual' is contained in the same document you will use to analyze today's data ([Passive Membrane Properties](../passive-membrane-models/Lab-Manual_passive-membrane-models.ipynb). 

Broadly, you will use electrical circuit models of a passive cell membrane to introduce yourself to some of the basic components of your essential electrophysiology toolkit. You will perform "intracellular" and "extracellular" measurements of membrane potential and, in an intracellular configuration, measure the membrane potential response to an "injected" current. 

Follow the instructions in the [Passive Membrane Properties](../passive-membrane-models/Lab-Manual_passive-membrane-models.ipynb) page after opening it in Colab (using the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/modules/passive-membrane-models/Lab-Manual_passive-membrane-models.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Open In Colab" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"/></a> button here or at the top of the notebook page). Upload any files from the PC to your Google Drive as needed to access data from the Colab runtime. 

Write your responses to the questions in the [Responses](../passive-membrane-models/Responses_passive-membrane-models.ipynb) page after opening it in Colab (using the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/modules/passive-membrane-models/Responses_passive-membrane-models.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="Open In Colab" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"/></a> button here or at the top of the notebook page). Upload any images or figures (in '.jpg' or '.png' format) that you create to your Google Drive so that you can insert them into your responses. After you have completed your work, 'Save as PDF' and upload to Gradescope.
