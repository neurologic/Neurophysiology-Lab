# Week 5. Muscle Receptor Organ

Crayfish stretch receptor. Information theory. Tuning curves. Rate Coding.

Stretch-sensitive receptors are a type of proprioceptor that is embedded in or parallel to muscle fibers. In humans, we call these <i>muscle spindle organs</i> and in crustaceans we call these <i>muscle receptor organs (MROs)</i>. Stretch-sensitive receptors encode information about muscle stretch (and therefore joint position). Information about joint position then helps guide body movements.

You will use extracellular recording techniques to explore the sensory encoding of stretch in MROs of the crayfish.  The creayfish MRO a muscle receptor analogous to the human muscle spindle and participates in the motor control of the crayfish abdominal
extensor muscles.
