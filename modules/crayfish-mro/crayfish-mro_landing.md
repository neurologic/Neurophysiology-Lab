# Week 5. Muscle Receptor Organ

Stretch-sensitive receptors are a type of *proprioceptor* that is embedded in or parallel to muscle fibers. In humans, we call these receptor-muscle pairings *muscle spindle organs* and in crustaceans we call these **muscle receptor organs (MROs)**. What information do proprioceptors encode? How does spike rate encode that information? What factors explain changes in proprioceptors spiking activity? You will investigate these questions by extracellularly measuring the electrical activity of MRO axons.

In crayfish, the superficial extensor muscle on each side of each abdominal segment (and in the two most posterior thoracic segments) are innervated by stretch-sensitive receptors. The superficial extensor muscles span adjacent segments, running from one tergite to the next. When these muscles contract, they pull the tergites together, causing the abdomen to straighten and extend (thus the name). Conversely, when the abdomen is curled ventrally, the tergites rotate around their joints and the extensor muscles are stretched, along with their associated MROs. MRO neurons receive inhibitory synaptic innervation from the central ganglion (this does not occur in vertebrate proprioceptors). These inhibitory inputs depress the receptor activity.

Importantly, there are only two MRO cell types innervating each segmental superficial extensor muscle in crustaceans. The axons of the two MROs travel together from their dorsal muscles, laterally around the large abdominal muscles, to the ventral nerve cord to enter the abdominal ganglia as part of the second ganglionic nerve (nerve 2).
