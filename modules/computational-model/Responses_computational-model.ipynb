    "**Prompt 1:** Complete the **Steady State Model** section of the Data Explorer. Make a diagram of your circuit from Lab during week \\#1 with the values of each component you used clearly labeled (each resistor you picked and each battery that you measured the actual voltage of). In the diagram, make sure that the polarity (directionality) of the voltage sources are clear. In the diagram, annotate where you put your electrodes to measure membrane potential and the value of that measurement.
