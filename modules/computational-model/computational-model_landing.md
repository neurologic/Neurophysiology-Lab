# Week 4. Computational Models

Computational modeling of neurons and neural circuits is an important component to neurobiology research in general. Today, we will work on building and interrogating computational models that capture some basic electrophysiological properties of neuron membranes. These will build on the principles [you learned by utilizing electrical circuit models of neuron membranes](../passive-membrane-models/passive-membrane-models_landing.md))).

How does the term *computational model* make you feel?
