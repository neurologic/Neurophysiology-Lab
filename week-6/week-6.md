# Week 6. Motor Neuron Coding

In crayfish, the ventral branch of the third nerve (N3v) in each abdominal ganglia innervates the superficial flexor muscle in the corresponding segment of the tail. The superficial muscle seems to maintain the posture of the animal. Motor neurons of the N3v are tonically active while the animal is at rest or performing terrestrial walking (Moore and Larimer, 1988). Motor neurons that innervate deep muscles instead generate brief bursts of action potentials associated with the powerful tail-flip. 

You will continue to improve your surgery technique as you learn the surgery to access N3v today. You will continue to build off of this same surgery to complete the next several labs. 

cell types (implications of different axon diameters on conduction velocity)
regularity of spiking
recruitment under different environmental conditions (swimmeret versus telson stim, etc)
differences between different ganglia
