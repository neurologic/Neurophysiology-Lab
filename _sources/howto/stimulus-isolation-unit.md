# Stimulus Isolation Units

There are three different stimulator models currently available in the lab, that each have similar functionality, but different controls. They are all called *Stimulus Isolating Units* (**SIU**). The two SIUs that are at the rigs for today are the **Grass SD-9** and the **AM-Systems**.
