There are lots of instructions in the Data Explorer that lead you through ***way more*** steps than you need to do for this week. The Prompts specify in what way you should be utilizing specific tools in the Data Explorer and to what extent. \n",

    "The sample rate was 30000 on two channels (channel 0 was the MRO signal and channel 1 was the stimulus monitor). The stimulus is a PWM signal to a servo motor to bend the tail. The recording was taken with the photographed preparation in the lab manual and the videos provided in the last section."

    "    > No need to do explicit research on this (if you do want to search literature, \"spike-frequency adaptation\" is a common term). Think about what causes the graded membrane potential changes in mechanoreceptor neurons in the first place, and then what effects the spike rate of neurons (driven by graded membrane potential changes). Think about what changes to a neuron's physiology could change its spike rate. Etc... For example, one mechanism could be a slow potassium conductance that is activated by more depolarized potentials. Can you think of others?\n",

Do a search for \"spike rate adaptation\" or \"spike frequency adaptation\" and find one paper that reports a useful reason for its existence in sensory processing. Report the citation of that paper (APA style is fine). \n",
