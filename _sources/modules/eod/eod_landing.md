# Week 2. Electric Organ Discharge

Some fish see and speak using electricity - behaviors termed *electrosensation* and *electrocommunication*. Mormyrids are a group of teleost fish with an electrocommunication system. You will use electrophysiology methods to eavesdrop on electric fish behavior.

Weakly electric fish essentially have a battery in their tail. It is made of modified muscle fibers, which means that it is innervated by motor neurons. Acetylcholine is released at this neuro-electric junction and, in response, the modified muscle fibers become polarized in parallel to produce a dipole-like electric field source.

Therefore, when you place a pair of electrodes in the water near the fish, you can measure the voltage produced by the fish. Different species of fish polarize their batteries (the *electric organ*) with different timecourses. In other words, across time, the polarization waveform is *species-specific*.

<figcaption align = "center"><b>Electric organ discharge (EDO) waveform</b> in three snoutfish species of southern Africa across sexes. All EODs are plotted as voltage over time, recorded immediately after capture. Same time bar for all. (a) Sexual dimorphism in Marcusenius altisambesi with two distinct waveforms. (b) Sex difference of only a statistical nature in Petrocephalus catostoma (Upper Zambezi form) with, in most males, a stronger second positive phase than in females, such as shown here. (c) Petrocephalus wesselsi (Sabie River, South Africa) with no difference between the sexes. P. wesselsi was recognized as distinct from P. catostoma only recently.

Weakly electric fish use the electric field generated by their pulse-like *electric organ discharges* (EODs) to communicate with each other (*electrocommunication* and to sense the physical environment around them (via distortions of the electric field cause by the physical environment; *electrolocation*).
