# Week 6. ElectroRetinoGram

Receptor cells typically respond to stimuli with prolonged, graded potentials. Some receptor cells also have spike-generating mechanisms. Photoreceptor cells in the eyes of arthropods like the crayfish generally cannot produce spikes.

The *electroretinogram* (ERG) is a measurement of the summed (net) potential of many photoreceptors (recorded extracellularly). The waveform of the ERG is a good representation of intracellular events in the photoreceptors, as demonstrated by *simultaneous* intra- and extra-cellular measurement of photoreceptor potentials[^Stieve_1978]. As in other extracellular recordings, depolarization of the cells appears as a negative potential to the electrode outside the cells.

Photoreceptors transform light energy into electrical energy via *second messengers*. Photoreceptor transduction has mostly been studied in *Drosophila* (another species in the Phylum *Arthropoda*)[^Hardie_2001]. Transient receptor protein (TRP) channels are the ultimate target of the molecular cascade initiated by rhodopsin-detected photons. You will notice a lag between the time in which the second messenger system is activated by rhodopsin and the opening of TRP channels.

:::

Changing the brightness of the light will change the number of rhodopsin molecules that are activated, and thus the amount of second messenger that is produced. This is analogous to varying the amount of transmitter at a metabotropic synapse.
