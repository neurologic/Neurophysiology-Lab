# Week 12. Human BCI Music

Creating novel movement-based music spaces using a Brain Computer Interface... on ***YOU***. 

In vertebrates, every voltage spike in a motor neuron generates a voltage spike in the muscle fibers it innervates. A single motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates are called a *motor unit*. In humans, the only single-unit neural activity that we can measure non-invasively is from motor neurons. We measure motor neuron activity via muscle voltage spikes. Muscle voltage spikes can be measured by electrodes placed on the surface of the skin overlying the muscle. 

You will acquire electromyograms using differential surface electrodes above the *belly* of up to 8 muscles simultaneously.
