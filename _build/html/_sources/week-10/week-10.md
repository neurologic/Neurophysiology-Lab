# Week 10 Human Motor Neuron Coding 

Multiple motor neurons innervate the same muscle. How is the activity of each motor neurons uniquely related to different aspects of movement? How can you record the activity of individual motor neurons in your own nervous system?

Today's module kicks off a series of explorations into movement and motor systems in humans -- ie. YOU.
