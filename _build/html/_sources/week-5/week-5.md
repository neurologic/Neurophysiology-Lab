# Week 5 Sensory Coding

Crayfish stretch receptor. Information theory. Tuning curves. Rate Coding.

learn the surgery to access the motor nerve while keeping the superficial flexor muscle healthy


Before starting this lab, you should be familiar with:
<ul>
<li>What an action potential is</li>
<li>The basics of electrophysiology</li>
<li>How measuring action potentials from either inside or outside of a cell affects the data collected</li>
<li>The basic anatomy of the crayfish and nervous system</li>
</ul>

Stretch-sensitive receptors are a type of proprioceptor that is embedded in or parallel to muscle fibers. In humans, we call these <i>muscle spindle organs</i> and in crustaceans we call these <i>muscle receptor organs (MROs)</i>. Stretch-sensitive receptors encode information about muscle stretch (and therefore joint position). Information about joint position then helps guide body movements.

You will use extracellular recording techniques to explore the sensory encoding of stretch in MROs of the crayfish.
