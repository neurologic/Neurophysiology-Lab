# Standards

This course uses a continuous "standards-based" grading format. For each of the following sections, you will be assessed throughout the course. Your grade (0-5) will increase as you achieve and master more skills in each section. This standards-based assessment will be averaged across sections at the end of the course and count toward 80% of your final grade. 

____ / ____ **Concepts** (Demonstrated through Response notebooks)
- V = IR
- T = RC
- Signal versus noise
- “spike sorting” (the effect of electrode placement on the recorded signal)
- “spike sorting” (spike differences from neuron differences)
- Baseline/spontaneous activity
- Spike coding (rate versus count versus timing)
- ADC conversion
- Signal processing
- Raw data
- Processed data
- Quantification of neural responses: rates, amplitudes, times
- Ionic basis of the membrane potential
- Geometric view of big data

_____ **Experimental Skills** (Demonstrated during lab)
- Patience (what tools can you find to increase this skill)
- Persistence
- Identifying when something is wrong
- Brainstorming potential issues and solutions
- Taking steps to troubleshoot 
- Demonstrating good “noise reducing” practices
- Recognizing when the “ground” is not in the prep/bath
