# Standards

As described in the syllabus, 20% of your final course grade is determined using a *standards-based* (also called *mastery*-based) grading format.  

This document contains a list of the *standards* (*aka* learning targets) for which your mastery be assessed throughout the course. They are organized according to five broad categories.  

*Standards-based* assessment occurs throughout the semester and provides feedback about where you are on the scale of *mastering* each standard. Your score (0-3) for each standard is continuously updated (not averaged across assignments) to reflect your current level of mastery. Feedback about progress is provided throughout the course. You should feel empowered to track your progress, identify next steps in understanding each standard, and communicate your progress to me in addition to me communicating my observation of your progress to you.

At the end of the semester, your mastery scores will be averaged across all sections.

## Personal Goals For Yourself in the Course
(How will you demonstrate your achievement in these?)

Please consider goals that you have for yourself (why are you here?) that you can work to achieve. These will not count toward your grade, but you will still get feedback and assessment on them.
