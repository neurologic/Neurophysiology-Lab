    "# Experimental Design for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As you found in week 2 (<a href='https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/week-2/Electric-Organ-Discharge.ipynb' target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dynamic Electrical Signals</a>), weakly electric fish vary their EOD rate over time. Is this variation random or is there non-random structure in it? If there is non-random structure, do the fish change their EOD rate in response to something in the environment or just spontaneously? How can you determine if a stimulus evokes a response? This notebook provides a tutorial on ways to approach this kind of analysis. We will not inclusively cover all possible approaches, but rather focus on basic principles of trial-based experimental design and the estimation of results under <i>null</i> hypotheses. After you complete your work, think about other questions that you are interested in and what kinds of experimental design considerations you would need to implement to analyze the data. "
