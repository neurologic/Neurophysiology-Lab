# ## Part II. Import raw data ('.bin' file)
# ### Edit the code cell below with the appropriate information, then play/execute the cell
# - **filepath** is the path to your ".bin" data file that has simultaneous recording of muscle and nerve. 
#   - filepath needs to be in quotation marks.
#   - ***if you are on a windows operating system computer, you need an "r" before the first quote of the filepath***
# - **number_channels** = the number of inputs to the analog to digital converter were recorded.
# - **nerve_channel** and **muscle_channel** which analog input channel was the nerve amplifier hooked up to? This is "nerve_channel" and the same logic applies to "muscle_channel"
# - **sampling_rate** is the sampling rate that you recorded data at
# 
# ### You will also get a plot of your raw data from both channels (nerve in blue and muscle in green).
# - You can interact with the plot by zooming in and panning. <br>
# - You can make the plot bigger or smaller by dragging its bottom right corner (gray triangle). Note that when it gets smaller the axis labels might disappear.
# - You can save the current plot view at any time by hitting the "save" icon - it will save to your Downloads folder. <br>

# ## Take Home: Answer the following questions in a separate document to turn in.
# > *When asked to report amplitudes of events (spikes or PSPs), correct for the amplifier gain (1000x for the extracellular amplifier and 10x for the intracellular amplifier).*
# 
# ### Figure 1. *Synaptic connections between pre- and post-synaptic cells*
# Only compare intracellular recordings using the same motor nerve. 
# - How many motor neurons did you record spikes from?
# - Which of these neurons evoked synaptic potentials that you recorded intracellularly from the muscle cell?
#   - Make note of different intracellular recording locations as needed.
# - We know that all of the 6 motor neurons in Nerve 3 synapse on the superficial flexor muscle. Were your results for each intracellular recording location consistent with this? If not, how do you explain the inconsistency? Did you see responses to different motor neurons at different intracellular recording locations?
# 
# ### Figure 2. *Synaptic **dynamics** - the timecourse of synaptic connectivity*
# Only compare intracellular recordings using the same motor nerve. 
# - How many motor neurons did you record spikes from? *only do this if it is different than in Figure 1, otherwise refer to Figure 1)*
# - For each panel of the figure (each PSP), annotate the following:
#   - the delay between the pre-synaptic spike time and the psp
#   - the psp rise time (the time from the onset of the psp to the peak of the psp)
#   - the psp amplitude 
# - Make it clear which panels are from the same intracellular recording and which are from different.
# 
# ### Figure 3. *Stereotypy of Pre to Post synaptic transformations - Does synaptic summation effect post-synaptic potential amplitude?*
# Because you will *"normalize"* your data, you can combine data using different motor nerves. 
# - Use recordings with distinct PSPs associated with a distinct neuron (identified by waveform amplitude).
# - Quantitative procedure for each intracellular recording:<br>
#   - Measure the amplitude of 5 solitary PSPs associated with that pre-synaptic neuron. 
#   - Find examples of synaptic summation. Measure the amplitude of the second PSP (from PSP onset, not from resting membrane potential). Measure the latency between the onset of the first PSP and the onset of the second PSP. If there are more than two PSPs in a row, compare sequentially.
# - Analysis: 
#   - Within each intracellular recording, divide all amplitudes by the mean solitary PSP amplitude. This enables you to plot data from different recordings together.
# - Visualization: 
#   - Use a program such as google sheets or excell to make a plot of PSP amplitude versus latency (the solitary PSPs will have a latency of 100ms). 
# 
# ### Figure 4. *Pre to post-synaptic transformations* 
# In any of your recordings *from the same motor nerve recordings*, did you see PSPs in repsponse to different neurons? (If not, then you won't have a figure - instead you will just answer the second bullet point.
# - Did either psp onset slope correlate with spike amplitude?
#   - To answer this question (are they correlated) use a spreadsheet program to make a scatter plot of psp onset slope (rise time / amplitude) against spike amplitude. 
# - Use what you have learned in your neuroscience courses (and what we have learned this semester in lab) to name two reasons why:
#   - the PSP amplitude could be different in response to different pre-synaptic neurons
#   - the PSP amplitude could be different at different intracellular recording locations (different muscle cells or different locations along the same muscle cell)
#
