# # Motor Coordination and Big Data
# 
# This notebook provides tools for interacting with multi-channel EMG data collected using differential electrodes, Backyard Brains amplifiers, Nidaq acquisition hardware, and Bonsai-rx recording software. 
# 
# Throughout the notebook, you will plot both raw and processed data.
# - You can interact with the plots by zooming in and panning. <br>
# - You can save the current plot view at any time by hitting the "download" icon - it will save to your Downloads folder. Make sure to re-name the auto-generated file and make notes about what you plotted right away. <br>
# 
# The plotting tools available in this notebook include:
# - raw EMG data with each channel plotted separately
# - emg amplitude envelopes with each channel plotted separately
# - selected subsets of emg amplitude envelopes overlaid on the same plot
# - 3D plotting of the first 3 principal components of muscle activity for a specific range of data selected
# 
# The data processing and analysis tools available in this notebook include:
# - amplitude envelope smoothing
# - data range selection within a file
# - correlation of activity (of the amplitude envelopes) across recording channels
# - Principle Component Analysis on all recorded channels (channels may be dropped from the analysis in the step when you load the data)

# # Part II. Plot the rectified, smoothed "amplitude envelope"
# [toc](#toc)
# 
# This is a type of *signal processing* that transforms raw EMG activity (a bipolar signal - both positive and negative values) into what we refer to as the *amplitude envelope* of the EMG activity. The "smoothing" of the envelope results in a waveform that reflects both the amplitude and the rate of the raw EMG signal (accounts for both spatial and temporal summation). Therefore, absolute voltage information is lost, but you can still compare relative voltage across channels and across recordings that used the same electrode configurations.
