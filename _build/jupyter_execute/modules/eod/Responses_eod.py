# For each species, what was the approximate duration of the EOD?

# ...

# ***Prompt 12:** Think back to your other neuroscience courses. Draw a typical neuron's action potential and describe what physiological events across the cell membrane cause the following components of the waveform shape:*
# - *baseline (resting) voltage*
# - *polarity*
# - *change in polarity*
# - *amplitude* 
#     
# ```{hint} 
# Insert an image from your google drive in a markdown cell by doing the following... 
# 
# Get the "Anyone can view" share link from google drive. 
# With a  share link in the following format: https://drive.google.com/file/d/ID-of-image-/view?usp=sharing,
# all you need is the *ID-of-image* from the URL share link. 
# 
# Enter editing mode on the Markdown cell below.
# 
# In the template URL provided, replace "1WoAa-oMOkAj9r9lyls4nLSLyIeuTu4Ae" with the ID from the link you see in your google drive's "share link" screen for your image.
# 
# Then "run" the markdown cell (or double click it). Your image will replace the one provided.

# ***Prompt** What effects each feature of the EOD waveform shape in your recording?:* 
# - polarity
# - amplitude
# 
# *Use plots of 3 different EOD waveforms (from different parts of the recording) and put them together in a cohesive figure to describe. Along with your written explanation, paste your figure below following the template provided in the markdown cell (insert your figure by replacing the "id" in the link below with your google drive share link id).*

# What (in the raw signal) would you consider "noise" and what would you consider "signal". Include an annotated representative segment of your raw data to demonstrate.

# Use a figure with a legend to report the results of the bootstrapped average EOD rate analysis, comparing across all species tested. Include the boxplot and scatter overlay of the bootstrap results for each species. Specify the parameters you used for the analysis (and the total duration of data for each species used in the analysis).

# How did the average EOD rate (total average) that you wrote a script to calculate compare to the boostrapped average?  

# ...

# Compare the *smoothed* EOD time series (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/modules/eod/Data-Explorer_eod.ipynb#four" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electric Organ Discharge: Part IV</a>) to the EOD *isi* (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/modules/eod/Data-Explorer_eod.ipynb#three" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electric Organ Discharge: Part III</a>). How do they relate to each other (visually)? From the smoothed time series, how could you calculate a proxy for the average EOD *rate*?

# What analyses discussed throughout these responses would the ADC rate effect? Why/How?
