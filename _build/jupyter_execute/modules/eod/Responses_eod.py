# ## Passive Membrane Models continued...

# ***Prompt 1: What is the biological equivalent of the battery (the voltage applied across the membrane) in the neuron membrane model from IV?***

# ...

# ***Prompt 2: What was different between the membrane potential response to (the same) applied current with verusus without a capacitor in the circuit? What was the same between the membrane potential response to (the same) applied current with verusus without a capacitor in the circuit?***

# ...

# ***Prompt 3: Would you expect small neurons to have higher or lower membrane resistance than large neurons? Why?***

# ...

# ***Prompt 4: Would you expect small neurons to have higher or lower capacitance than large neurons? Why?***

# ...

# ***Prompt 5: Analagous to the space constant, the time constant of a neuron membrane is the time it takes for the membrane potential to change by 63% of its original value in response to an applied current across the membrane. Calculate the time constant of the model membrane in Part IV.*** 

# ...

# ***Prompt 6: One of the most used equations in neurophysiology is $V=IR$, where $V$ is voltage, $R$ is resistance, and $I$ is current. Another well-loved neurophysiology equation is $\tau=RC$, where $R$ is resistance and $C$ is capacitance, and $\tau$ is the time constant of the membrane. Refer to your results from Part IV to complete the following (show your work):***
# 1. ***Use the amplitude of the experimentally-applied stimulus current and the corresponding measured change in voltage to calculate the model membrane's Resistance (compare your result to the value of the resistor tha that you used). NOTE: make sure to account for the amplifier's amplification factor.***
# 2. ***Use the time constant that you measured and the resistance that you calculated from \#1 to calculate the capacitance of the model membrane (compare your result to the value of the capacitor that you used).***

# ## Electric Fish

# ***Prompt 7: For each species, what was the approximate duration of the EOD?***

# ...

# ***Prompt 8: What effects each feature of the EOD waveform shape in your recording?:***
# - ***polarity***
# - ***amplitude***
# 
# *Use plots of 3 different EOD waveforms (from different parts of the recording) and put them together in a cohesive figure to describe. Along with your written explanation, paste your figure below following the template provided in the markdown cell (insert your figure by replacing the "id" in the link below with your google drive share link id).*

# ***Prompt 10: Use a figure with a legend to report the results of the bootstrapped average EOD rate analysis, comparing across all species tested. Include the boxplot and scatter overlay of the bootstrap results for each species. Specify the parameters you used for the analysis (and the total duration of data for each species used in the analysis).***

# ***Prompt 11: How did the average EOD rate (total average) that you wrote a script to calculate compare to the boostrapped average?***  

# ...

# ***Prompt 12: Compare the smoothed EOD time series (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/modules/eod/Data-Explorer_eod.ipynb#four" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electric Organ Discharge: Part IV</a>) to the EOD isi (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurologic/Neurophysiology-Lab/blob/main/modules/eod/Data-Explorer_eod.ipynb#three" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electric Organ Discharge: Part III</a>). How do they relate to each other (visually)? From the smoothed time series, how could you calculate a proxy for the average EOD rate?***
