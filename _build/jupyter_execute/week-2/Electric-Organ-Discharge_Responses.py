# Report the results of the bootstrapped average EOD rate analysis, comparing across all species tested. Include a figure with the scatter boxplot overlay of the analysis for each species. In the legend specify the parameters you used for the analysis (and the total duration of data for each species used in the analysis).

# Is the EOD waveform shape in your recording analagous to the waveform shape of an "canonical" action potential recorded intracellularly or the waveform shape of an extracellularly recorded action potential? Why?

#     Compare the <i>smoothed</i> EOD time series signal (<a href="..week-2/Electric-Organ-Discharge.ipynb#four" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electric-Organ-Discharge: Part IV</a>) to the EOD isi (<a href="../week-2/Electric-Organ-Discharge.ipynb#three" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electric-Organ-Discharge: Part III</a>). We could use the smoothed time series signal as a <i>proxy</i> for isi (and instantaneous rate). Why/How? Therefore, from the smoothed time series signal, how could you calculate a proxy for the average EOD rate?
