# <font color = "green">What electrical circuit component that you used in this lab best describes ion channels in the cell membrane?</font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">When a set of ion channels (selective for Potassium, for example) opens, what happens to the resistance of the membrane?</font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">When a set of ion channels (selective for Potassium, for example) opens, what happens to the conductance of the membrane?</font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">When you attach a voltage source across the model membrane, are you "injecting a current" or are you "injecting a voltage"?</font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">What is the biological equivalent of the battery in the passive membrane electrical circuit model?</font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">What part of the action potential were you simulating in the first part of the lab (modeling intracellular versus extracellular recordings). And which ion conductance did this most closely simulate?</font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">
# What was the scaling factor for the measured peak amplitude between the intracellular and extracellular configuration (extracellular amplitude divided by intracellular amplitude)? 
# </font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">Would you expect small neurons to have higher or lower membrane resistance than large neurons? Why?</font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">Would you expect small neurons to have higher or lower capacitance than large neurons? Why?</font>

# ...

# <font color = "green">The space constant is the distance it takes for voltage to decrease to 37% of its original value. Approximate the space constant of the model membrane using the intracellular measurements of trans-"membrane" voltage as the battery source travelled down the "axon".
# Calculate it first by starting at Node \#5 (the middle node) and then calculate it again by starting at Node \#7.</font>

# ...

# <div>
# <font color = "green">The space constant can also be calculated using the following equation:
# 
# $$
# \lambda = \sqrt{\frac{ R_{m} }{ R_{i} + R_{o} }}
# $$
# 
# What value do you get from calculating this way? 
# > Note that $R_{o}$ is usually so small compared to the other resistances that it can be ignored. (Why do you think it is so much smaller? In other words, what makes $R_{i}$ larger? And $R_{m}$?)
# </font>
# </div>

# ...

# <font color = "green">Think back to your other neuroscience courses. Draw a real action potential and describe what physiological events across the cell membrane cause the following components of the waveform shape: baseline (resting) voltage, polarity, change in polarity, amplitude. Insert your photo using the same instructions as <a href="#insert-photo">response \#1</a></font>
