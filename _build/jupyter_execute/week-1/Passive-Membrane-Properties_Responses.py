# In the absence of any passive or voltage-gated ion channels in the neuron membrane, what would determine the voltage across the membrane?

# ...

# Draw what you think the equivalent electrical circuit of a neuron's membrane would look like in this scenario.

# What electrical circuit component that you used in this lab best describes ion channels in the cell membrane?

# When a set of ion channels (selective for Potassium, for example) opens, what happens to the conductance of the membrane?

# ...

# When you attach a voltage source across the model membrane, are you "injecting a current" or are you "injecting a voltage"?

# ...

# What is the biological equivalent of the battery in the passive membrane electrical circuit model?

# ...

# What part of the action potential were you simulating in the first part of the lab (modeling intracellular versus extracellular recordings). And which ion conductance did this most closely simulate?

# ...

# Would you expect small neurons to have higher or lower membrane resistance than large neurons?
