# Fifth Hour

Our time, outside of lab and with a shared computer scrreen, to go over tools and concepts related to the labs.

## Week 2 on Tues, Sept 13 at 1:30-2:30

[Re-do of a video giving you a tour through the data processing and analysis tools for the EOD data this week](https://wesleyan.zoom.us/rec/share/h63PehTOIKpbPXR_FUsBOGZ0m5mtbmZivtwb_ifk1bEHbk5rtOJYfxXC_0a-VBj1.gIFxk-mJjK_L23mA?startTime=1663159456000)

[Original recording from Tuesday.](https://wesleyan.zoom.us/rec/share/_cCU-zLOUFAsCSp1UarufCB9AYL9BVqmudfsxrs8heFM7pa6g0r-Xck7yx82ixJo.GqBeZoCo647h9A9m) After doing a walkthrough of the Data Explorer notebook during 5th hour I made some edits to simplify the work that I was asking you to do for the week. So the notebook shown here is different than the one you are actually working with (see link to a re-made video above).

## Week 3 on Wed, Sept 21 at 2:30-3:30

Agenda:
- V=IR and T=RC experiment design and analysis review
- CAP examples and more visualization of the concept
- What data from Part II. Experiment 1 would you compare in a single panel?
- Figure quality tips

I made this [Electrode Geometry](howto/electrode-geometry) document (found in the "howto" section of the website) that reviews some of the utility and impact of electrode geometry in examining neural activity. This phenomena depends on a combination of a neuron's space constant and action potential duration.
