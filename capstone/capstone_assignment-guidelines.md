# Capstone guidelines

A "*Presentation* of Learning‚Äù in which you either go solo or pair up with a partner to prepare materials to *demo* your favorite lab from the semester (whether you will be doing the actual live demo of the experiments will depend on availability of resources, etc). You will have 2 hours to do your actual experiments/demos (but I can prepare animals for you ahead of time). You will prepare individual write-ups of the materials in addition to presenting them in a 5 min "data blitz". 

Components:

- Live Demo
- 5 min Data Blitz
- Write-up

## Live Demo

***On Monday Dec 5 during the normal class time*** 

An in-lab practical in which you will set up the equipment (and animals as needed) and run your experiment. Show off your skills. This event will be open to anyone that wants to come visit lab that day and take a tour of what you have been hard at work doing. You will record data that day, but you will not have to analyze the results quantitatively. The focus is more on demonstration of your learning and sharing your experimental ideas and interests. You can have any draft Figures or other materials from your write-up printed out to help you explain what you expect to accomplish in your experiment. 

## Write-up

***Due Dec 9***

The write-up is in the format of a well-rounded scientific communication including the following sections: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion (and References). Good quality Figures with Captions should be included throughout. Graded for academic merit. 

### Introduction

Background information. For example: concepts and anatomy that is needed to interpret the results. If you are presenting an experimental exploration beyond what was explicitly done in class (*highly encouraged*), then include the results from the first experiment that led you to follow up and extend the experiment in your proposed way. 

### Materials and Methods

What kind of recording method? Electrode placement and reasoning for it. 

### Results

Data from previous labs can be used as examples. Diagrams and "mock data" plots that you predict for your proposed experimental exploration. 

### Discussion

What your results mean in the context of more general neuroscience or biomedical concepts. 

### References

APA style.

## Data Blitz

***Due Dec 9***

5 minutes. A recorded video presentation providing an overview of the main points and highlights from your experiment. Graded for clarity and breadth.
