Background and Introduction
All living cells maintain a difference between internal (intracellular) and external (extracellular) solutions, including major differences in the concentrations of important ions intracellular vs extracellular. One result of this is that all living cells have a voltage - a potential difference across the cell membrane (inside ‘negative’ compared to outside). This is called the resting membrane potential of the cell. 


What makes neurons special and different from almost all other cells is that they make critical use of changes in this membrane potential in order to accomplish their jobs as computational and communication units. As we all know, inputs received at the synapse cause graded changes in potential (via synaptic receptors) that then summate to produce output as impulses. 


Neurophysiology is the study of the physiology of neurons and a major part of their physiology are these electrical potentials (electrophysiology). Electrophysiology is the main subject of this course, though we will connect neurophysiology with other tools for studying animal behavior such as motion tracking and genetic tools.


General neuroscience topics covered in this course include:
Ionic basis of rest potentials, synaptic physiology, active voltage impulses, sensory responses, simple circuits, motor system physiology. 


Classroom Behavior and Expectations
You should expect long, often open-ended labs: there will not be as much structure as you may be accustomed to. Electrophysiology is active and often exploratory - online (as in ‘in the moment’ not as in ‘via the internet’).


You should gain skills in:
- Quantitative and analytical thinking
- Data analysis and presentation
- Communication of experimental observation and data interpretation
- Use of instrumentation, simple electronics and troubleshooting, problem solving
- Fine motor skills and surgery


Of you I ask:
- 100% effort
- Independence and self-motivation
- Patience when things do not go well and willingness to push yourself to learn as much as you can about the neurons and systems that you will examine.
- Notice things in your data; pay attention to detail; ask questions (to yourself as well as to others and to me)


We’ll be working together to create an equitable and inclusive environment of mutual respect, in which we all feel comfortable to share our moments of confusion, ask questions, and challenge our understanding. Everyone should be able to succeed in this course. If you do not feel that is the case please let me know. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.


Course Resources
This course will be using Google Classroom to manage content and grades.


Schedule (subject to change)
See the "Weekly Materials" section. 


Class Preparation and In-Class Materials
These are found in the Weekly Materials section under each weekly chapter. Additional resources are located in the “General” section. Any readings that need to be completed in preparation for the session will be listed with PDFs provided.


Assignments
There are 7 total lab-based assignments (each covering two lab sessions, with the exception of the first). These are found under the “Assignment” section of the Google Classroom “Classwork” tab. Assignments will be mostly graphical and written. Assignments will involve using custom scripts to explore, process, and analyze data. All assignments should be handed in as good-quality PDFs.
You may conspire with others to tackle the assignments. However, all work handed in must ultimately be your own. 
There is one capstone assignment: a “Demonstration of Learning”. Details are provided in the Google Classroom under the “Assignments” section.


Grading
10% Classroom Participation
-attendance 
-helpful to peers and to instructor during class
-verbally engages in inquiry and discourse 
-preliminary assessment completed in class
-midterm assessment completed in class
-capstone assessment completed in class


10% The Capstone Assignment (“Demonstration of Learning” Due last day of Finals Dec 17) will be graded on a letter scale. 
Detailed expectations are outlined in the assignment tab on Google Classroom.


80% The bulk of your course achievement will be assessed using “Standards-Based” grading techniques based on your in-class work and the 7 Assignment write-ups due throughout the semester.
Along the way, as you complete each classroom session and the assignments, your personal Assessment score card will be updated. You will continue, throughout the semester, to work toward proficiency in each category outlined. Your score will be on a 0-5 scale based on how many of the target goals are met and how well they are met. With each assignment, you will get feedback about how to improve in each category - this feedback can also be communicated through individual meetings during office hours. The final score in each category is weighted equally at the end of the assessment period, which closes on December 11th the first day of the reading period.  




Animal Care and Use Procedures:
Live animal subjects are generally essential in behavioural research, but nonanimal alternatives such as video records from previous work or computer simulations can sometimes be used. We will be implementing some of these in this course. We will be using the following invertebrate animals in this course: cockroach, crawdad, and fruit fly. We will use humans (ourselves) for one non-invasive module. 


Managing pain and distress: It is impossible to know whether cockroaches, crawdads and fruit flies experience damage in the same way that we do. Suffering is a negative mental state – a private experience – and, as such, it cannot be measured directly. When assessing the capacity of an animal to experience suffering, we often compare the similarity of its responses with those of 'higher' animals, conceptualized in the principle of argument-by-analogy. They clearly lack the brain organization that underlies our experience of pain and the emotional distress that goes with it. However, this does not mean that their minds or lives are necessarily less valuable nor that they have different brain organization that underlies their experience of pain or distress that goes with it. 
        For vertebrates, IACUC is the regulatory division that oversees the ethical care and use of animals in teaching and research. There is currently no standardized regulatory measures covering the care and use of invertebrates in teaching and research. For this course, I follow the guidelines outlined by the Association for the Society of Animal Behaviour (https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/ASAB2006.pdf), including the following: “Pain or suffering should be minimized both in duration and magnitude as far as possible under the requirements of the experimental design. Attention should be paid to the provision of proper pre- and post-procedural care to minimize preparatory stress, and immediate and residual effects. When a study involves any procedure or condition likely to cause more than momentary, low-intensity pain, discomfort or distress,then appropriate anaesthesia, analgesia, tranquillization and/or adjunctive relief measures should be used, sufficient to prevent or alleviate the discomfort, unless this would jeopardize the aims of the study.”
For any invasive procedures, we will be using the standard protocol of cooling (on ice) to anaesthetize the animal. Because invertebrates do not regulate their body temperature, cooling slows all metabolic processes, including the neural processes involved in perception and movement.


Environmental impact: Since Procambarus is raised in large numbers for food, its use in lab exercises has minimal environmental impact. Cockroaches and fruit flies have a reproductive strategy in which massive numbers of individuals are produced. In nature, the majority will not make it to adulthood. The number of these animals that we use in this lab therefore have minimal impact on their ecology.


Email Policy
I do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours. However, I cannot guarantee email communication over the weekend as this time is reserved for family.


Time Commitment
Attendence in classroom sessions is not optional. If your in-class work is finished before the classroom session ends, you can use the additional time to work on Take Home work or explore the preparation further.  I have designed the class so that it should be feasible to satisfactorily complete the requirements with approximately twelve hours per week of time commitment. If you are spending more time than this on a regular basis I encourage you to check in with me.
