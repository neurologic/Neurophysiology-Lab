**Background and Introduction**  
All living cells maintain a difference between internal (intracellular) and external (extracellular) solutions, including major differences in the concentrations of important ions intracellular vs extracellular. One result of this is that all living cells have a voltage - a potential difference across the cell membrane. This is called the resting membrane potential of the cell. 


What makes neurons special and different from almost all other cells is that they make critical use of changes in this membrane potential in order to accomplish their jobs as computational and communication units. As we all know, inputs received at the synapse cause graded changes in potential (via synaptic receptors) that then summate to produce output as impulses. 


*Neurophysiology* is the study of the physiology of neurons and a major part of their physiology are these electrical potentials (*electrophysiology*). Electrophysiology is the main subject of this course, though we will connect neurophysiology with other tools for studying neurons and animal behavior such as computational models, motion tracking, and genetic tools.


General neuroscience topics covered in this course include: ionic basis of membrane potentials, synaptic physiology, active voltage impulses, sensory responses, simple circuits, motor system physiology. 


**Classroom Behavior and Expectations**  
You should expect long, often open-ended labs: there will not be as much structure as you may be accustomed to. Electrophysiology is active and often exploratory in the moment.


*You should gain skills in*:  
- Quantitative and analytical thinking
- Data analysis and presentation
- Communication of experimental observation and data interpretation
- Use of instrumentation and basic electronics
- Troubleshooting and problem solving
- Fine motor skills and surgery


*Of you I ask*:  
- 100% effort
- Independence and self-motivation
- Patience when things do not go well 
- Learn as much as you can about the neurons and systems that you examine
- Notice things in your data; pay attention to detail; ask questions (to yourself as well as to others and to me)


We’ll be working together to create an equitable and inclusive environment of mutual respect, in which we all feel comfortable to share our moments of confusion, ask questions, and challenge our understanding. Everyone should be able to succeed in this course. If you do not feel that is the case please let me know. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.

:::

**<font color="green">Weekly Responses</font>** *60%*  
Due each Sunday by midnight. Each week, there is an associated "Response" document containing prompts that you need to respond to. These assignments will involve using custom scripts in the "Data Explorer" pages to explore, process, and analyze data collected during lab. You may conspire with others to tackle these weekly assignments. However, all work handed in must ultimately be your own. 

**<font color="orange">Capstone</font>** *20%*  
A "*Presentation* of Learning” in which you pair up with a partner and prepare materials to *demo* your favorite lab from the semester (whether you will be doing the actual live demos of the experiments will depend on availability of resources, etc). You will prepare individual write-ups of the materials in addition to presenting them in pairs in person. Details will be provided on the course website in the "Wrapping Up" section.  

**<font color="purple">Standards</font>** *20%*  
Along the way, as you complete each classroom session and the assignments, your personal [Standards score card](../standards) will be updated. You will continue, throughout the semester, to work toward proficiency in each category outlined. Your score (0-3) for each standard is continuously updated (not averaged across assignments) to reflect your current level of mastery. Feedback about progress is provided throughout the course in writing and in meetings. You should feel empowered to track your progress, identify next steps in understanding each standard, and communicate your progress to me in addition to me communicating my observation of your progress to you. At the end of the semester (which closes on December 11th), your mastery scores will be averaged across all sections. 

***Attendence*** in classroom sessions is mandatory. If unforseeable emergency comes up, please reach out as soon as possible so that we can make a plan.  

**Animal Care and Use Procedures:**  
Live animal subjects are generally essential in behavioural research, but nonanimal alternatives such as video records from previous work or computer simulations can sometimes be used. We will be implementing some of these in this course. We will be using the following invertebrate animals in this course: cockroach, crawdad, and fruit fly. We will use humans (ourselves) for one non-invasive module. 

*Managing pain and distress*: It is impossible to know whether earthworms, cockroaches, crawdads and fruit flies experience damage in the same way that we do. Suffering is a negative mental state – a private experience – and, as such, it cannot be measured directly. When assessing the capacity of an animal to experience suffering, we often compare the similarity of its responses with those of 'higher' animals, conceptualized in the principle of argument-by-analogy. They clearly lack the brain organization that underlies our experience of pain and the emotional distress that goes with it. However, this does not mean that their minds or lives are necessarily less valuable nor that they have different brain organization that underlies their experience of pain or distress that goes with it. 

For vertebrates, IACUC is the regulatory division that oversees the ethical care and use of animals in teaching and research. There is currently no standardized regulatory measures covering the care and use of invertebrates in teaching and research. For this course, I follow [the guidelines outlined by the Association for the Society of Animal Behaviour](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/ASAB2006.pdf), including the following: “*Pain or suffering should be minimized both in duration and magnitude as far as possible under the requirements of the experimental design. Attention should be paid to the provision of proper pre- and post-procedural care to minimize preparatory stress, and immediate and residual effects. When a study involves any procedure or condition likely to cause more than momentary, low-intensity pain, discomfort or distress,then appropriate anaesthesia, analgesia, tranquillization and/or adjunctive relief measures should be used, sufficient to prevent or alleviate the discomfort, unless this would jeopardize the aims of the study.*”

For any invasive procedures, we will be using the standard protocol of cooling (on ice) to anaesthetize the animal. Because invertebrates do not regulate their body temperature, cooling slows all metabolic processes, including the neural processes involved in perception and movement.


*Environmental impact*: Since Procambarus is raised in large numbers for food, its use in lab exercises has minimal environmental impact. Cockroaches and fruit flies have a reproductive strategy in which massive numbers of individuals are produced. In nature, the majority will not make it to adulthood. The number of these animals that we use in this lab therefore have minimal impact on their ecology.

**Email Policy**  
I do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours. However, I cannot guarantee email communication over the weekend as this time is reserved for family.


**Time Commitment**  
Attendence in classroom sessions is mandatory. If your in-class work is finished before the classroom session ends, you can use the additional time to work on Take Home work or explore the preparation further. I have designed the class so that it should be feasible to satisfactorily complete the requirements with approximately twelve hours per week of time commitment (as per the standards for a full credit course). If you are spending more time than this on a regular basis I encourage you to check in with me.

**Covid Safety**  
Covid-19 remains a major public health crisis, and as such a threat to education. In line with peer institutions and CDC guidelines, to protect the particularly vulnerable among us, and to preserve our ability to meet in person, masking is the default for our classroom and lab instruction. Please wear N95, KN95, or KF94 masks. Your mask should fit properly over both your nose and mouth. If you need a mask, please let me know. After the first two weeks of instruction, and upon evidence of low community spread (as defined by the CDC), we may decide to make masking optional after an anonymous survey of the class. Please test yourself at any signs of Covid symptoms. If you have tested positive or have symptoms that you think are Covid related, please do not come to class. We will make arrangements for you.

**Writing Workshop**
Working on your writing? Don’t go it alone! Instead, make a free one-on-one appointment with peer writing tutors at the Writing Workshop. Trained to help Wesleyan writers at any stage of the writing process, writing tutors are available for online appointments, Sunday - Friday at a range of times. Let us help you get your ideas out of your head and onto paper!  
Make an appointment by going to Wesportal→ Academics-->Writing Workshop Account. You’ll be asked to make an account before being brought to our online scheduler.  
Want semester long support? Apply for a writing mentor who will work with you for an hour every week. Focus on specific writing tasks like organization and time management with the help of a trained peer all while earning a .25 credit!
