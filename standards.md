# Standards

20% of your grade in this course is determined using a "*standards*-based"/"*mastery*-based" grading format. This document contains a list of the *standards* (learning targets) that you will be assessed on. These standards are categorized into five broad course goals. The assessment occurs throughout the semester and consists of feedback about where you are on the scale of *mastering* each standard. Your grade (0-5) is continuously updated (not averaged across assignments) to reflect your mastery of each standard. The progress you have made (your final score) will be an average across sections at the end of the course. Throughout the course you should feel empowered to track your progress, identify next steps in understanding each standard, and communicate your progress to me in addition to me communicating my observation of your progress to you.
