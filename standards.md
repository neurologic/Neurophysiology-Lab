# Standards

This course uses a continuous "standards-based" grading format. For each of the following sections, you will be assessed throughout the course. Your grade (0-5) will increase as you achieve and master more skills in each section. This standards-based assessment will be averaged across sections at the end of the course and count toward 80% of your final grade. 

____ / ____ **Concepts** (Demonstrated through Response notebooks)
- V = IR
- T = RC
- Signal versus noise
- “spike sorting” (the effect of electrode placement on the recorded signal)
- “spike sorting” (spike differences from neuron differences)
- Baseline/spontaneous activity
- Spike coding (rate versus count versus timing)
- ADC conversion
- Signal processing
- Raw data
- Processed data
- Quantification of neural responses: rates, amplitudes, times
- Ionic basis of the membrane potential
- Electrical circuit modeling
- Computational modeling
- Geometric view of big data

_____ **Experimental Skills** (Demonstrated during lab)
- Patience (what tools can you find to increase this skill)
- Persistence
- Identifying when something is wrong
- Brainstorming potential issues and solutions
- Taking steps to troubleshoot 
- Demonstrating good “noise reducing” practices
- Recognizing when the “ground” is not in the prep/bath
- Maintaining tissue health (surgical delicacy, maintaining fresh solutions when needed)
- Not breaking the glass electrodes
- Independent research exploration
- Helpful to peers and to instructor during class
- Verbally engages in inquiry and discourse

_____ **Data Visualization / Presentation** (Demonstrated through Response notebooks)
- Turned in as good quality graphics (readability)
- Figures are clear (font size, axis zoom, resolution, etc)
- Figures are relevant to the point being made
- Figures do not include extraneous information 
- Figures include all relevant information
- Labels are all correct
- Legends are concise yet thoroughly provide information needed to interpret figure.
- A logical selection of potential options has been curated to make a point

_____ **Execution and Communication of Data Processing, Analysis, and Interpretation** (Demonstrated through Response notebooks and Capstone)
- Using clear non-jargon language to describe what you observe
- Correct use of experimental and neurophysiology vocabulary
- Clear descriptions of any data processing steps
- Clear descriptions of any analysis steps/tools
- Uses analysis tools appropriately 
- Describes analysis results correctly
- Writing (speaking) is clear (requires first clear thinking) using effective sentence structure (no run-ons, active voice).
- Demonstrates logical reasoning
- Demonstrates critical thinking
- Shows attention to what is being asked
- Makes connections between data and neuroscience concepts
- Demonstrates attention to detail beyond what is asked
- Poses relevant hypotheses to frame work when applicable

_____ **Foundational Computing Skills** (Demonstrated during lab and in ability to complete assignments)
- Keeping track of files
- Maintaining logical file structure
- Saving data
- Keeping track of metadata
- Not saving loads of not data
- Basic level of Python coding to explore and analyze data when prompted (and beyond if desired)
- File transfers across computers 

_____ **Personal Goals For Yourself in the Course** (How will you demonstrate your achievement in these?)
> Please consider goals that you have for yourself (why are you here?) that you can work to achieve.
